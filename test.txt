Project Overview: File Encryption and Decryption with OS Multithreading and Event Handling in C++
Objective:
To develop a robust file encryption and decryption system using C++ that incorporates advanced operating system concepts such as multithreading for performance optimization and parent-child process communication for event handling.

Key Features:
File Encryption and Decryption:

Encrypt files using a symmetric key algorithm (e.g., AES, XOR-based encryption for simplicity).
Decrypt files with the corresponding key to restore the original content.
Support for multiple file formats.
Multithreading:

Utilize multithreading to process large files efficiently by dividing them into chunks.
Threads encrypt or decrypt chunks simultaneously to enhance speed.
Parent-Child Process Communication:

Use parent and child processes to manage file operations and event handling.
The parent process monitors tasks and handles file I/O.
The child process performs the actual encryption or decryption using shared memory or pipes.
Event Handling:

Handle events such as task completion, errors, or termination.
Use inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms like signals or semaphores for synchronization.
Error Handling and Logging:

Provide detailed logs for encryption and decryption processes.
Handle errors such as file not found, incorrect keys, or permission issues gracefully.
Cross-Platform Compatibility:

Design the system to be compatible with Windows, Linux, or macOS using platform-specific libraries like pthread or std::thread.
Implementation Details:
File Operations:

Use fstream for file reading and writing.
Read files in binary mode to handle all file types.
Encryption/Decryption Logic:

Implement a simple XOR cipher or integrate an existing library like OpenSSL for AES encryption.
Ensure secure key management.
Multithreading:

Divide the file into fixed-size blocks.
Assign each block to a thread for parallel processing.
Use std::thread or platform-specific threading libraries.
Parent-Child Communication:

The parent process spawns child processes using fork() (Linux) or CreateProcess() (Windows).
Use IPC methods such as pipes or shared memory to transfer data and signals.
Event Handling:

Use semaphores or condition variables for thread synchronization.
Implement signal handling for parent-child process communication (e.g., SIGCHLD for task completion).
Flow of Execution:
User selects a file and specifies encryption or decryption.
Parent process divides the file into chunks and creates threads for processing.
Threads encrypt/decrypt their respective chunks.
Parent process monitors thread execution and combines processed chunks.
Child process signals completion or error events to the parent process.
The final encrypted/decrypted file is generated and saved.
Technologies and Tools:
Languages: C++
Libraries:
std::thread, pthread (for multithreading)
OpenSSL or custom encryption library
IPC Mechanisms: Pipes, signals, shared memory
Development Tools: g++/clang++ (Linux), MSVC (Windows)
Potential Challenges:
Synchronizing threads to avoid race conditions.
Ensuring compatibility across different operating systems.
Securely handling encryption keys to prevent leaks.
Future Scope:
Add support for asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA).
Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for non-technical users.
Optimize performance for extremely large files.

Dividing a File into Chunks and Handling by Parent Process
Step 1: File Division into Chunks
To divide a file into chunks, the parent process reads the file in binary mode and splits it into smaller, manageable blocks. These blocks can then be processed independently by threads or child processes.

Implementation:
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <vector>

#define CHUNK_SIZE 1024  // Define the size of each chunk in bytes

std::vector<std::vector<char>> divideFileIntoChunks(const std::string &fileName) {
    std::ifstream inputFile(fileName, std::ios::binary); // Open the file in binary mode
    std::vector<std::vector<char>> chunks;

    if (!inputFile) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Error: Unable to open file!");
    }

    while (!inputFile.eof()) {
        std::vector<char> chunk(CHUNK_SIZE);  // Allocate a chunk buffer
        inputFile.read(chunk.data(), CHUNK_SIZE);
        size_t bytesRead = inputFile.gcount();  // Get the actual bytes read
        
        // Resize the chunk to fit the actual data read
        chunk.resize(bytesRead);
        
        // Push the chunk into the vector if it contains data
        if (!chunk.empty()) {
            chunks.push_back(chunk);
        }
